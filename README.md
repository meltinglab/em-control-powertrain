# Modeling of powertrain and transmission for an electric car
 
## Abstract
The goal of the project is to model and simulate the powertrain of an electric vehicle, from the motor down to the 
wheels. The project has been realized following the model-based design approach. The overall model has been designed
in Simulink, then the controller for the electric motor was deployed on a real microcontroller, namely a Raspberry 
Pi 3, exploiting automatic code generation. Simulation results have been compared with the corresponding data from a
real-world Volkswagen e-Golf, in order to validate the model.
